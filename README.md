[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5467a3ba695680560000a53d/badges/15de1d9d02bca4851dd1/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5467a3ba695680560000a53d/feed)

A code repository for the environmentality web application

The app will work on both mobile and desktop platforms and serve as a tool to educate the masses on the Chesapeake bay and the effect that people have had on it.  It will also contain an element of rewards based on activities that the user takes part in that helps the bay recover.
